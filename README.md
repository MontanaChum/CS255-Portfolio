# CS 255 Portfolio Submission

**Project Summary:**  
The DriverPass project was made for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The system needed to manage user accounts, allow online practice tests, track student progress, and let instructors monitor performance. The goal was to make learning more convenient and efficient for both students and instructors.

**What I Did Well:**  
I did a good job clearly organizing the business requirements and connecting them to the system design. I focused on breaking the system into simple parts and showing how each part would meet the client’s needs.

**What I Would Revise:**  
If I could improve one thing, I’d make the visuals in the system design document stronger. Adding more detailed UML diagrams and labels would make the design easier to understand for others reviewing it.

**Understanding User Needs:**  
I paid close attention to what the client wanted—an online system that improves training and tracking. I made sure my design included features like login access, test results, and scheduling. It’s important to consider user needs because even a great system fails if it doesn’t help the people using it.

**Approach to Designing Software:**  
When designing software, I like to start by understanding the main goals and sketching out how the system will work before writing any code. In the future, I’ll keep using flowcharts, UML diagrams, and user stories to help analyze requirements and build designs that make sense to both developers and clients.
